A test repo that demonstrates testing and code coverage.

## What cool things do you get?
1. `npm run test` # Runs all tests
2. `npm run test-unit` # Runs only unit tests
3. `npm run test-integration` # Runs only self-integration tests
4. `npm run coverage` # Runs istanbul coverage analysis
4. `npm run test-prod` # Runs all tests, coverage anyalysis, and uploads results to Code Climate
5. `npm run clean` # Removes node_modules and other temporary items so you can start the project fresh

## OK, anything else neat about this?
1. Express logging with Morgan
  1. `EXPRESS_LOG_FORMAT` # defaults to "OFF", set to "dev" or any Morgan log level
1. Bunyan logging is built in
  1. `BUNYAN_LOGLEVEL` # defaults to "OFF", set to "debug" or any valid Bunyan log level
2. Loggly support if you supply the creds in the env variables
  1. `LOGGLY_LOGLEVEL` # No default
  2. `LOGGLY_SUBDOMAIN` # No default
  3. `LOGGLY_TOKEN` # No default
3. Code Climate code coverage analysis
  1. `CODECLIMATE_REPO_TOKEN` # No default, used to upload coverage results when running `npm run test-prod`

## Getting started
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
